MD041 What is Terraform Backend?

Storing terraform state file in remote location in order to work multiple developers at a time. so that backend will be called always from remote location.

Each Terraform configuration can specify a backend, which defines where and how operations are performed, where state snapshots are stored, etc.

If you are still learning how to use Terraform, we recommend using the default local backend, which requires no configuration.
If you and your team are using Terraform to manage meaningful infrastructure, we recommend using the remote backend with Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise.

What Backends Do
There are two areas of Terraform's behavior that are determined by the backend:

Where state is stored.
Where operations are performed.

Backend Types:
Enhanced: backends can both store state and perform operations. There are only two enhanced backends: local and remote.
Standard: backends only store state, and rely on the local backend for performing operations.
